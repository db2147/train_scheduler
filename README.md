In this assignment I created a train scheduling application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and deparature data.&nbsp; This app retrieves and manipulates this information with Moment.js.&nbsp; This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their destination.

I use the database variable (which is defined as firebase) and append the traininfo there.&nbsp; This helps us calculate the next train time.

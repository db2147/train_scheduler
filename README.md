In this assignment I created a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and deparature data.&nbsp; This app retrieves and manipulates this information with Moment.js.&nbsp; This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

I use the database variable (which we defined as firebase) and append our traininfo there.&nbsp; This helps us calculate the next train time.
